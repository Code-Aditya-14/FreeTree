# FreeTree

Free open-source alternative for linktree.

I created this project because I don't want to create a linktree's account and I don't want to be limited in terms of customization

## Main Features

* Simple to add/edit/remove buttons (just edit data.json file)
* Highly customizable if you have CSS skills (just edit style.css)
* Free to use (you can host this on GitHub Pages)
  * If you are using GitHub Pages, you can use your custom domain for free

## When you should use Linktree

My goal in this project is to have an alternative to Linktree using static page, so Linktree have some feature that's not viable in this project. For example:

* Link Scheduling
* Code Gated Links

## How to use

You can use any static website hosting, e.g.: GitHub Pages, DigitalOcean App.
