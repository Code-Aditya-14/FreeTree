# Contributing

email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Development

There's a problem with CORS if you open the HTML directly in your browser, there's 2 ways I see to avoid this:
1) Use XAMPP, Apache or something like that in your localhost
2) Use GitHub Pages (you will need to commit-push to see your changes and will need to wait some time until github update the page)
  2.1) If you gonna use GitHub Pages and will only change the style.css, I recommend you to edit style.css inside Chrome DevTools for better productivity (don't forget to save your changes (a.k.a.: copy and paste to your code editor and save))

## Pull Request Process

1. If you are using any media resource (image, font, etc), please, ensure that don't have any copyright restrition.
2. If you made changes to "how to use" this project, please, ensure to update the README.md with details of changes.
